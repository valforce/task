Name: Trần Thu Phương
Class: 20E3
I. Summary
- According to the speaker, art and music have great impacts on patients’ emotional, social and physical well-being.
- In 1860, Florence Nightingale noted that her patients had recovered quickly, thanks to brightly coloured flowers and art.
- Many studies did not prove the existence of a link between art, music and health, but there were a few that strictly controlled.
- In the 1980s, the effect of architecture on patients’ recovery time was looked at by the American study.
- The result showed that the patients who were in front of nice view left hospital earlier as well as needed less painkiller.
- The speaker gave three kinds of research on three types of patients.
+ Unborn babies
This study took place in London.
Babies’ heart rates controlled when they listened to live music.
Not only did the babies recorded to be healthy, but the mothers also felt more relaxed.
+ Cancer patients
Artistic pictures were hanged on the wall in their treating room and were changed weekly.
The patients felt a bit eased from the pain since the images eased their mind.
The survey recorded that patients health had improved.
+ Elderly patients
They played thirty minutes of soothing classical music, but not every day.
The patients said they did not have many worries on the day they had music played.
Unexpectedly, the staffs liked the treatment so much that they did not want to leave the hospital.
