- In 1860, Florence Nightingale noted that her patients had been recovered quickly thanks to brightly colored flowers and art.
- Many studies did not prove the existence of a link between art, music and health, but there were a few that strictly controlled.
- In 1980s, the effect of architecture on patients’ recovery time was looked at by the American study.
- The result showed that the patients who were in front of nice view left hospital earlier as well as needed less painkiller.
